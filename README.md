# Pomodoro

A [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer made with Python and Tkinter.

Usage: Click `start` to begin, work for 25 minutes then get a 5-minute short break; after the 4th work session take 
a 20-minute break. Click `Reset` to start over.

Feel free to minimize the window, it will pop up when the timer is complete so that you don't miss it.
